Made by Garret Moran using Raknet and SFML.

More of a tech demo than a game. It's a pong game that works across multiple computers. Uses an authoritative server. 
To play, run the exe 3 times, set one to (S)erver and then have the other two connect as (C)lients, putting in the IP address of the server.

Game starts immediately upon connecting. Exiting a client will not crsh the game, but will make it remarkably one-sided.
Both players use arrow keys to move, therefore it is recommended to run the clients on separate machines.
