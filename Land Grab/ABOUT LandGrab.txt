Made in a team of several people.

A 4-player game about alien farmers fighting over flat planets and cutting out sections for themselves.
Plant stakes into the ground in order to cut a line in the game field. 
Making a full shape of cut lines will cause the cut section to fall out and award points to the team that made the last cut.
Cut enemy players out of the map to eliminate them and score more points.
The farther you are from a planted stake the slower your character moves.
Players can also plant a crop that will slowly spread across the map. Cutting some of the plants out nets extra points.
Cutting the plant source out will stop the plant from continuing to spread.
Dash into other players to make them drop their stake. Powerups fall as meterors, cut them out to collect them.
