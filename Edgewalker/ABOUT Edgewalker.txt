Made exclusively by Garret Moran.

Originally done as a flash game, I remade this simple platformer using XNA and added some neat visual touches.
The core mechanic lies in that the player will not fall upon stepping off a ledge unless they jump.
French translation more than likely provided by Google translate. Je suis désolé if it's horribly wrong.
