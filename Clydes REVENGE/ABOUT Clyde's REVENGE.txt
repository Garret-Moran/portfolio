Made by myself (Garret Moran) and Tony Libardi (both of us programmers).

Synopsis: A 2-player game where one person controls Pacman and the other controls 2 ghosts at once.
Clyde is CPU controlled (moving randomly). He counts as being on the ghosts' team. 
Ghosts try to corner Pacman to defeat him. Pacman can turn the tables by grabbing a power pellet.
While powered, ghosts move slower and Pacman can eat them. 

Pacman can screenwrap but ghosts cannot (except Clyde).
Last team standing wins.

Game can be exited via pause menu and upon re-opening will resume where the match left off (Save and Exit).
